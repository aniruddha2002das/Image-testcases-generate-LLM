# Multimodal LLM Testing Instructions Generator Tool

## Overview
This project is a Testing Instructions Generator Tool that utilizes a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to describe detailed testing instructions for any digital product's features based on screenshots and optional context. It provides step-by-step test cases including descriptions, pre-conditions, steps, and expected results.

## Features
### Front-end:
- **Text Box for Optional Context:** Allows users to input context or specific requirements for the testing instructions.
- **Multi-image Uploader:** Users can upload one or more screenshots of the digital product.
- **Describe Testing Instructions Button:** Upon clicking, the tool generates the testing instructions based on the screenshots and optional context.

### Back-end:
- **Multimodal LLM Integration:** Processes the screenshots and context to generate a detailed step-by-step guide on how to test each feature.
- Each generated test case includes:
    - **Description:** A summary of what the test case is about.
    - **Pre-conditions:** Requirements that need to be met before testing.
    - **Testing Steps:** Clear, step-by-step instructions for the testing process.
    - **Expected Result:** What the user should observe if the feature is functioning correctly.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask (Python):** For building the back-end web server.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building the front-end interface.
- **Multimodal LLM (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash):** For processing images and generating textual test instructions.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library):** To handle image uploads and conversion.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive front-end design.
